# RESTAspect
A GUI built using the materialize css framework and jQuery. Very simplistic allowing you to set the method,
add headers and data parameters. The results from the request are shown on the right side of the screen. 

To use, download the zip and place it at an accessbile location in a web server.

More functionality to come.
